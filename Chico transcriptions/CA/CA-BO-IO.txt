Parent: Sure. That's very clever, that's very clever. Okay. [laughs] All right. So, Issac, I just... What do you think of this game, this task? Was it hard? Was it easy? Was it funny?

[00:17:22.284]

Child: It's too easy.

[00:17:24.454]

Parent: It's too easy? What would've made it harder?

[00:17:27.884]

[00:18:01.418]

Parent: Yeah. So it's not the, it's not the task, but it's rather the, the words that we, we're thinking of. That could have been harder?

[00:18:10.005]

Child: Yeah.

[00:18:12.697]

Parent: It's like, uh, like the jokes you told earlier. What was it? Like, uh, like the one about the butterfly, uh, ca-, a caterpillar?

Child: No.

[00:18:53.206]

Parent: What starts green...

[00:18:54.615]

Child: Well, what starts green, and afterwards white, and afterwards multicolor.
