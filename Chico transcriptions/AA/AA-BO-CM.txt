[00:18:36] Interviewee: Yeah, I think that I, I think maybe it was too long I didn't play this game, [laughs] first of all, yeah. I, I think when I was younger, I had better strategies to... [laughs]

[00:18:49] Interviewer: Yeah.

[00:18:51] Interviewee: And, um, yeah, it was funny. Like for the blueberry one, I was totally out of...I was not thinking at all about stuff to eat, stuff to... The city really misled my thoughts, like...

[00:19:06] Interviewer: Yeah.

[00:19:07] Interviewee: ...so bad. And, uh, yeah. What was the...I think the difficulty was just my brain not... [laughs]

[00:19:19] Interviewer: Well, I know, yeah, it's funny, I, I felt like we, um, were, like, focused in on something and it's difficult to, to, uh, look outside of that focus, uh.

[00:19:39] Interviewee: [inaudible 00:19:39]

[00:19:47] Interviewee: Yeah. Actually, that's, that's right. I then asked colors because when you were asking question, I was like, "If he only asked about colors...

[00:19:56] Interviewer: Yeah.

[00:19:56] Interviewee: ...he would understand immediately." So I asked about color, but then blue, I was like, "Oh, oh [inaudible 00:20:03]"

[00:20:03] Interviewer: Yes.

[00:20:04] Interviewee: Yeah. Also maybe in my brain, actually, blueberries doesn't exactly go in the blue...you know?

[00:20:13] Interviewer: Yeah. [laughs]

[00:20:16] Interviewee: Yeah. Yeah [laughs] No, yeah, yeah. But I was thinking about blue, blue, blue, and that was...um, yeah.

[00:20:26] Interviewer: Mm-hmm.

[00:20:27] Interviewee: I guess I was not thinking about stuff to eat at all or fruit, so category of the...and um, yeah. Um, yeah, it also took me a long time to get to plants you know. [laughs]

[00:20:48] Interviewer: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, thinking about, yeah, material, or artificial, or natural, um, color, I don't know, for... And we...ne-, neither of us talked about sound at all, um... [laughs]

[00:21:03] Interviewee: Yeah, but it's all good. It's true. And also, like, for example, actually, uh, at the, when I thought about rainbow, I was like, "Oh la la, how can I...?" Because like, actually, when it was my turn for the blueberry, I tried, I actually asked many questions I thought would be useful for you during your turn. So I asked colors, as I said, but then I also ask, can we touch it?

[00:21:32] Interviewer: Mm-hmm.

[00:21:33] Interviewee: Because also for... And actually the boundaries of what an object is.

[00:21:40] Interviewer: Yeah.

[00:21:41] Interviewee: In the...like...

[00:21:44] Interviewer: I, I don't know, like blueberry, I wouldn't, I wouldn't consider as an object, but...

[00:21:49] Interviewee: Yeah.

[00:21:50] Interviewer: It's a plant, but...

[00:21:52] Interviewee: Yeah. But w-w-what would, um, we need, I think, maybe something, for example, I think that, for example, when I was playing this game when I was younger, I think we had, you know, connection, like, what do we mean by object, right?

[00:22:07] Interviewer: Mm-hmm.

[00:22:08] Interviewee: So I think that object for us was anything that was not living, right? Or...?

[00:22:15] Interviewer: Right.

[00:22:16] Interviewee: ...I don't no.

[00:22:16] Interviewer: So gravity? [laughs]

[00:22:19] Interviewee: No. [laughs] There would be concept. No, it's not...

[00:22:25] Interviewer: Yeah, I mean...right.

[00:22:27] Interviewee: Yeah, I don't know. But anyways, yeah, actually we don't have super strict boundaries of these, uh, right? It is...uh, I dunno, right?

[00:22:38] Interviewer: Uh, I think we're good then, I think...
